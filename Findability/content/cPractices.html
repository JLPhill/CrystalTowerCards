			<h2>Align Your Content with Search Intent</h2>
			<p class="practicesp">
			Search intent is a great way of improving your SEO as Google constantly uses it to give users who search for specific data the most relevant result. User searches can be broken down into 4 different categories that specify the type of information they are looking for.<br><br>
			Navigational: Usually used when users are not sure of the URL they are looking for but have a specific website in mind. Example: Facebook Login, Instagran, Readit etc.<br><br>
			Informational: When a user is looking for specific information or data relating to a topic/subject. Example: What is the weather today?, What are the best practices for SEO?<br><br>
			Commercial: Searching for a specific product but do not know what to buy or is undecided. <br><br>
			Transactional: Lastly this type of search is for users who have the intention of making a purchase. Usually, they know what they want or where to purchase that product/service from.  <br><br>
			By aligning your content and website to that of these different user search categories, you are able to optimize your web findability and improve overall user experience. <br>
			A SEO best practice is to always keep the search intent in mind while creating content for your website. Ensuring that users have a reason to visit your website from blogposts about products, product pages, articles or service pages is a good way to increase your search engine ranking.

			<h2>Title Tag </h2>
			<p class="practicesp">
			Title tags are a deceptively simple and extremely useful way to improve your websites findability and useability. It is a way for the user to quickly understand what your page is and its primary use/function. This is important visually but also for relevance and accessibility. Including titles that include keywords, match search intent and that are clear and concise is a great way to give your webpages the extra edge they need. 
			</p>
		
			<h2> Meta description </h2>
			<p class="practicesp">
			Though not the most important factor in SEO, it is quite useful for making users visit your website through the search engine results page. Meta descriptions should contain keywords as well as a attractive summary of why the user should click on the link. SERP(Search Engine Results Page) will also highlight keywords used in the description!<br>
			•	150-160 characters is recommended.<br>
			•	Stay away from duplicate meta descriptions.<br>
			•	Try not to use quotes or any non-alpha characters as google leaves them out of the description.
			</p>
		
			<h2>Keywords</h2>
			<p class="practicesp">
			Content is the bread and butter of websites and is extremely relevant to Google search rankings. Keeping content unique and filled with keywords is great for searchability and findability. Adding key phrases are even better for SEO.
			Repeat keywords up to 4 times for stronger effectiveness but be careful not to overdo it as google may penalize you for duplicate content.
			Some use places to add keywords/phrases to:<br>
			•	URL Slug<br>
			•	Content <br>
			•	Alt text<br>
			•	Snippet title
			</p>
			
			<h2>Link building</h2>
			<p class="practicesp">
			Links are a underrated way of making the most out of your website’s findability. In order to maximize SEO, build links in all of your webpages. 
			Anchor links, Internal links, external links and backlinks all help to bind your pages content together for stronger accessibility and searchability.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Optimizing image/alt text</h2>
			<p class="practicesp">
			A staple in a well-functioning website, optimizing images and its alt text provides a faster loading time and better accessibility for web-readers and the visually impaired.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Creating useful/readable/visual content</h2>
			<p class="practicesp">
			Ensuring that content is easily readable not only helps users understand and digest information but it also improves the user experience. Using bullet points and headings to frame content is great for aesthetics and keeping your users attention. <br>
			Ways to make content better include the use of visuals such as images or videos. Using original data and review other competing content. Lastly, making longer content that is free of fluff and filler is a great way to increase your number of overall backlinks.
